\section sConfigIO I/O Configuration

I/O configuration panel as seen above allows the user to select one of the IO
interfaces.  Each of the two interface options are used for different
purpose(s). ARQ is selected when the user requires the use of the
FLDIGI suite of programs (FLARQ, FLMSG, FLAMP, etc). The KISS interface
is used with Ax25/ARQ networking software.  Currently the only
software tested and verified to work with FLDIGI's KISS interface is
BPQ32. See \ref bpq32_page "Using BPQ32 with FLDIGI"

\par Note:
Any changes to the IP Address and/or port numbers requires FLDIGI restart.

\subsection ssArqIO ARQ I/O

<br>

<br>

To select ARQ I/O, mouse click on the [ ] Enable ARQ check box. If the
checkbox is grayed out, this indicated the panel is locked. Deselect the
[ ] Lock checkbox to gain access.

The ARQ section of the configuration panel allow the user to set the
IP address and port number.  Pressing the [Default] button set the fields
to their startup values. In order for communications to occur both FLDIGI
and the FLDIGI suite of program must be assign the same IP address and port
number if the programs are used on the same computer. If the program are
running on different machines then the IP Address must be set accordingly
while maintaining the same port number. The IP Address entered is the
destination Address for the recipiente program/host computer.

\subsection ssKissIO KISS I/O

To select KISS I/O, mouse click on the [ ] Enable KISS check box.

Setting and configuring IP address and ports numbers are described in the ARQ
section.

\subsubsection ssDualPort Dual Port

Since the data exchange protocol is based on UDP/IP (connectionless) loopback
issues can arise if the two programs are hosted on the same machine. By
allowing more then one port number. The loopback condition can be
avoided.  Both programs must support dual port for proper communications.

\subsubsection ssKISSCsma KISS I/O CSMA

Selecting this option enables Carrier Sense Multiple Access. Basically in
conjunction with KPSQL it monitors for busy signals. When the frequency is
clear a small variable delay is initiated preventing the transmitter from
transmitting. This variance allows other CSMA stations time to monitor
the frequency in an attempt to prevent/limit packet collisions. Only available
when KISS I/O selected.

\subsubsection ssAx25Decode Ax25 Decoding

If the data received is using Ax25 protocol enabling this option translates
the protocol into human readable form. Only available when KISS I/O selected.

\par NOTE:
	When actived, only valid ax25 data will be displayed to the receive
	panel. No un-squelched random characters will be seen.

\subsubsection ssBusyChannel Busy Channel

Busy Channel when enabled and with the properly set threshold of the KPSQL
squelch. Frequencies that are intermittently present within the bandwidth of
the modem will inhibit the transmitter for the specified duration. This is a
useful feature to prevent your station from capitalizing the frequency,
allowing casual users to continue without interruptions from "BBS/Email"
type operation.

To prevent your station from transmitting between the grap of the RSID and
the data stream. Enable Busy Channel with a 1~2 second inhibit period.

\subsubsection ssKpsqlAttenuation KPSQL Attenuation.

Reduces the sensitivity of the KPSQL squelch.  Useful when a direct audio
card to audio card connection.

KPSQL monitors for differences in the signal strength within the bandpass
of the modem. Making it tolerant to AGC variations from the radio.

\subsubsection ssModemSelection  Modem Selection Kiss I/O

Use of the KISS I/O places a limit on the number of available modems. These
modems support 8 bit transfers. The slowest of these modems have been omitted
and generally comprise of the BPSK, 8PSK, MFSK, THOR, Contestia, Olivia and
MT63 at various baud rates. Any attempt to select a modem not supported FLDIGI
will ignore the request. If you are unsure, open the event log under the Help
menu and note a message indicating that particular modem is not supported.
