You should set the acquisition search range for waterfall left click
action. As you adjust this control you will see the red mode
width change on the waterfall scale. You can also adjust this
value by pointing the mouse to the waterfall. Hold down the
Control key and rotate the mouse wheel. The search routine which
finds the PSK signal operates on a s/n threshold detector as well as
recognizing the PSK phase modulation. You can adjust the
acquisition signal to ratio threshold for the search routine.
<br>

The PSK decoder estimates the signal to noise ratio, S/N, and the
intermodulation distortion, IMD, of the received signal. This
measurement is valid during periods when the other station is
transmitting the idle signal. The estimates are displayed on the
status bar. You can control how these values are displayed; <b>clear</b>
or <b>dim</b> after NN seconds. Setting the seconds to 0 disables the
clear/dim action.

Fldigi has a multi channel browser than can display simultaneous reception of
up to 30 PSK signals. The browser is described here:
<br>

8psk (8 phase states) does not use AFC for signal acquistion or tracking.  RsID
or operator adjustment of tracking point is necessary to align the decoder with
the received signal.  This mode includes the optional use of a pilot tone.  The
level of the pilot tone can be set relative to the total signal power.
<br>

This table shows the amount of transmit power used by the pilot tone
