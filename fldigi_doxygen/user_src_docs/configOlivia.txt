Olivia is a family of MFSK modes with a high redundancy Forward Error
Correction system similar to MT63. The family is very large, with 40 or
more different options, which can make it very difficult to work out which is
which. The mode works well on poor HF paths and has good sensitivity.
There are three popular modes, which have 8-FSK, 16-FSK and
32-FSK, thus having three, four or five bits per symbol. These
three modes can be selected without additional configuration. The
tone frequency spacing and integration period should always be left at
8 and 4 respectively unless you are experimenting with another station
running an Olivia modem that can be changed. These must always be
the same at both ends of the Olivia QSO. The modes have two
serious shortcomings - excessive bandwidth combined with slow typing
rate, and excessive latency which is the apparent typing delay caused
by the integration period.
